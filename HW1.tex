\paragraph{Notational reminders.}  Recall that when $X,Y$ are
bitstrings, $X \concat Y$ is the concatenation of the two.   When
$|X|=|Y|$, we write $X \xor Y$ for their bitwise exclusive-or.

\label{fig:guess}
\end{figure*}

Fix non-empty sets $\calK,\calD,\calR$ where $\calR \subseteq
\bits^*$, and let $F \colon \calK \times
\calD \to \calR$ be a function family (as usual, indexed by
$K\in\calK$).  In Figure~\ref{fig:guess} we define a new (toy) security
notion called the ``guess-the-LSBs'' notion.  In it, the adversary is
given access to an oracle for $F_K(\cdot)$ for a uniform, secret
key~$K$.  At the end of its execution, the adversary must output a
pair $(P,X')$ and wins the game if the $\tau$ least-significant bits
of $F_K(X')$ are~$P$.
Note that the
adversary does not get credit for outputting a pair $(P,X')$ such
that $X'$ was previously asked to its oracle; that would be cheating!
You can assume without loss that there are no pointless queries ---~in this case, no repeated
queries (because $F_K$ is deterministic) and no queries $X \notin
\calD$~--- and that $X' \in \calD$.

The $\tau$-LSB-guessing advantage of an adversary~$A$, against
function family~$F$, is
$\AdvGuess{F,\tau}{A}=\Prob{\ExpGuess{F,\tau}{A}=1}$.  
In the experiment we track the following adversarial resources: time
complexity~$t$, number of queries asked~$q$, and~$\mu$ the total
bitlength of all queries plus the length of the adversary's output.

({\bf Part a.}) Please fill in the following theorem, and provide a nice proof of it.

\begin{theorem}
Fix integers $N,\tau$ such that $0 < \tau \leq N$.
Fix non-empty sets $\calK,\calD$ and let $F \colon \calK \times
\calD \to \bits^N$ be a function family.  Let~$A$ be an adversary
using resources~$t,q,\mu$.  Then there exists a PRF-adversary~$B$
(explicitly constructed in the proof of this theorem) such that
\[
\AdvGuess{F,\tau}{A} \leq 1 \AdvPRF{F}{B} + \frac{1}{{{(2^\tau)}^2}^n} \mbox{   [fill in
  appropriate (small) constants $c_1,c_2$] }
\]
where $B$ has time complexity~$t'+q$,
asks $q'=q$ queries, these of total length
$\mu'=\mu$%[\mbox{FILL IN}]$.
\end{theorem}

\textbf{Part a.}

We will use $P_r[\ExpPRF{}{B} = 1]$ and condition this probability by the challenge bit $b$ for \ExpPRF{}{B}^{\calO(\cdot)}$.We need to construct adversary $B$ to simulate adversary~$A$.

\begin{comment}
\adversaryv{$B^{\calO}$}\\
(Y', X')$\leftarrow$ {$A^{\calO(\cdot)}$}\\
If $\calO (X')=Y'$ then Return 1\\
Return 0
\end{comment}

\begin{algorithm}
\renewcommand{\thealgorithm}{}
\caption{\textbf{adversary $B^{\calO}$}}
\label{alg:cap}
\begin{algorithmic}

\State $(Y', X') \gets A^{\calO(\cdot)}$
\If{$\calO (X')=Y'$}
\State \Return 1
\EndIf
\State \Return 0
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

When challenge bit $b=1$, adversary $A$ expects $F_K$ for a random key, which perfectly simulates $A$'s queries in $F_k$ or when challenge bit $b=0$, adversary $A$ expects random function $\rho$. Thus, $P_r[\ExpPRF{}{B} = 1 \;|\; b=0] = P_r[\ExpGuess{}{A} = 1 \;|\; b=0]$.


By construction, B has time complexity of $t'+q$, asks $q'=q$ queries, those total length $\mu'=\mu$. 

\vspace{0.5cm}

\underline{$b=1 \; so \; \calO = F_K$}

$P_r\left[\ExpPRF{}{B} = 1 \;|\; b=1\right] $

$=P_r\left[F_K(X') = Y' \right]  $

$=P_r[\ExpGuess{}{A} = 1 \;|\; b=1]$

($it \;is\; function\; family \;whose\; security \;is \;being \;examined$)

\vspace{0.5cm}

\underline{$b=1 \; so \; \calO = \rho$}

$P_r[\ExpPRF{}{B} = 1 \;|\; b=0] $

$= 1-P_r[\ExpPRF{}{B} = 0 \;|\; b=0]$

$= 1-P_r[\rho(X') = Y'] $

$= 1-\left[\frac{1}{{{(2^\tau)}^2}^m} \right]$


$\left(b=0 : \; |\Func(m,n)| = \frac{1}{{{(2^\tau)}^2}^m}$ because $|\Func(D,R)| = \frac{1}{{{(2^R)}^2}^D}}, $ F \colon \calK \times
\calD \to \bits^N$\right$

\vspace{0.5cm}

Hence, \\$P_r[\ExpPRF{}{B} = 1] = P_r[\ExpPRF{}{B} = 1 \;|\; b=1] 
+ P_r[\ExpPRF{}{B} = 1 \;|\; b=0]
$

$\AdvPRF{F}{B} = $\\
$=2\left[\frac{1}{2}(P_r(\ExpGuess{F}{A} =1)+
P_r(\ExpPRF{}{B} =1 \; | \; b=0)
)\right] -1$


$\left( \AdvPRF{F}{B} = 2\cdot P_r\left(\ExpPRF{F}{B} = 1\right) - 1 \right)$

\vspace{0.5cm}

$\AdvPRF{F}{B} $\\
$=2\left[\frac{1}{2}\left((P_r(\ExpGuess{F,\tau}{A} =1) + \left[1 -
\frac{1}{{{(2^\tau)}^2}^m}\right]\right)  \right]- 1
= 
\left P_r[\ExpGuess{F,\tau}{A}=1] - \frac{1}{{{(2^\tau)}^2}^m}}
$

Hence, $\AdvGuess{F,\tau}{A} \leq \AdvPRF{F}{B}+\left[\frac{1}{{{(2^\tau)}^2}^m}\right]
$

Since $c_2$ is \say{very small} we conclude that F is a secure $PRF$ and it follows that \say{Guess the LSBs} is secure, or difficult to guess LSBs.

\vspace{0.5cm}



({\bf Part b.})  The security bound that you proved in Part a should be a
function of the parameter~$\tau$.  Consider the full range of values
for $\tau$: When is the theorem most ``useful''.  What is the
relationship between the additive term~$c_2$ that you find, and the
``trivial'' winning probability?


\textbf{Part b.}

$\left|\AdvGuess{F,\tau}{A}-\AdvPRF{F}{B}\right| \leq \frac{1}{{{(2^\tau)}^2}^n}$

We can expect the behaviour of the oracle. When $\AdvGuess{F, \tau}{A}$ is close to 0, then the oracle behaves random function. 

Also, $P$ is a function of parameter $\tau$ and the additive term $c_2$ gets \say{tiny} when $\tau$ is a large number as its range is $2^\tau$ for all $0\leq \tau \leq N$ so the winning probability gets \say{tiny}.

\paragraph{Problem 2.}
Fix $k,n>0$ and let $E \colon \bits^k \times \bits^n \to \bits^n$ be a
blockcipher.  We would like to construct, from~$E$ an new blockcipher
that is ``wider''; in particular $F \colon \bits^k \times \bits^{2n}
\to \bits^{2n}$.  (Why build from~$E$, instead of building~$F$ from
scratch?  Maybe~$E$ is AES, or some other standardized blockcipher,
that has undergone years of cryptanalysis.  Better to build from that,
than to try to design your own $2n$-bit blockcipher.)  Here's the
candidate construction:  for every $K \in \bits^k, X \in \bits^{2n}$
let $F_K(X) = E_K(X_L) || E_K(X_R)$, where $X = X_L \concat X_R$.
(You can infer from the description of~$E$ that $|X_L|=|X_R|=n$.)

\begin{itemize}
\item Verify that~$F$ is, indeed, a blockcipher.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Proof F is a Blockcipher}
We know by construction that $E \colon \bits^k \times \bits^n \to \bits^n$ is indeed a blockcipher. Therefore to prove that $F \colon \bits^k \times \bits^{2n}
\to \bits^{2n}$ is also a Blockcipher, we will analyze the implementation of $F$. By hypothesis,  $X = X_L \concat X_R$. Begin by letting $X_L = L$ with $L \getsr \bits^n$ and $X_R \in \bits^n$. Since $E$ is a Blockcipher, we know that $E_k(X_R)$ will be a Bijection and so we will have a unique set of solutions to $F_k(X) = E_k({L}) || E_k(X_R)$ for all $X_R \in \bits^{n}$. Recall that $E_k({L})$ is constant for some $L$. Now, consider the case of $X_L = M$ with $M \getsr \bits^n - {L}$. We know again that $E_k(M) \neq E_k(L)$ using the fact that $E_k$ is Bijective. Hence for all $X_R \in \bits^n$ we know that $F_k(X) = E_k(M) || E_k(X_R)$ is also a unique set of solutions in terms of $X_L$ and $X_R$. Therefore, $F$ is  a Blockcipher.

\begin{itemize}
\item Show that~$F$ \emph{is not} a secure PRP, even if~$E$
  \emph{is}.  Specifically, give an attack ---~described as an
  adversary~$A$ and using the style and notation that we've seen in
  the videos~--- that uses just a few oracle queries, and not much
  running time, yet gains PRP-advantage against~$F$ that is close to
  1.  Please give a step-by-step analysis of the advantage, i.e.,
  carefully reason out an expression for~$\AdvPRP{F}{A}$, where~$A$ is
  \emph{your} adversary/attack. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Proof F is NOT Secure PRP}\quad
\\


\adversaryv{$A^{\calO(.)}_F$}\\
Query $\calO(0^n || 0^n)$\\
Call the Result $Y_L || Y_R$\\
If $Y_L == Y_R$ then Return 1\\
Return 0\\

$\AdvPRP{F}{A} = 2*[Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 1 | b = 1)Pr(b = 1) +  Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 1 | b = 0)Pr(b = 0)] - 1$\\

Because $Pr(b = 1) = \frac{1}{2}$ and $Pr(b = 0) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$ \\
\\
We can simplify \\
\\
$\AdvPRP{F}{A} = 2*[\frac{1}{2}Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 1 | b = 1) +  \frac{1}{2}Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 1 | b = 0)] - 1$\\
\\
Additionally, note that $Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 1 | b = 0) = 1 - Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 0 | b = 0)$\\


Then $\AdvPRP{F}{A} = 2*[\frac{1}{2}Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 1 | b = 1) +  \frac{1}{2}(1 - Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 0 | b = 0))] - 1$\\

Which simplifies to $\AdvPRP{F}{A} = Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 1 | b = 1) +  1 - Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 0 | b = 0) - 1$ = \\

$\AdvPRP{F}{A} = Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 1 | b = 1) - Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 0 | b = 0)$\\

By analyzing $Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 1 | b = 1)$ we can see that we will be testing our experiment against $F_K$ and we know that for $F_K(0^n|| 0^n)$ our adversary will output the correct result 1 by construction.\\ 
\\
Hence $Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 1 | b = 1) = 1$\\

Leaving us with $\AdvPRP{F}{A} = 1 - Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 0 | b = 0)$\\

Now, consider the term $Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 0 | b = 0)$\\
\\
We know that our Attacker will be querying against a random permutation since $b = 0$
\\

So, we need to consider the possibility that our experiment outputs a zero, which only happens if our Attack returns 1 - meaning our guess is incorrect. \\
\\
Because out attack calls $\calO(0^n || 0^n)$ to a random permutation, we need to analyze the probability that some output is symmetric.\\
\\
Since we have an output of the form $\bits^{2n}$ we know that given any left-hand side $\bits^{n}$ the probability that the other side will be the exact same for a permutation is $\frac{1}{2^n}$\\
\\
Hence, $Pr(\ExpPRP{F}{A} = 0 | b = 0) = \frac{1}{2^n}$\\
\\
$\AdvPRP{F}{A} = 1 - \frac{1}{2^n} \approx 1$ and we can see that $F$ is not secure PRP.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Problem 3.}
Let $E:\bits^k \times \bits^n \to \bits^n$ be a blockcipher.  From it,
construct $E^{(2)}\colon \bits^{2k} \times \bits^n \to \bits^n$ by
$E^{(2)}_{K1,K2}(X) = E_{K2}(E_{K1}(X))$. Prove that if $E$~is a
secure PRP, then so is~$E^{(2)}$.  

To get you started, here's a reminder of how to approach this
proof. Given an adversary~$A$ that attacks the PRP-security of
$E^{(2)}$, build an adversary~$B$ that attacks the PRP-security
of~$E$.  Carefully show that the PRP-advantage of~$B$ upperbounds the
PRP-advantage of~$A$, by analyzing the probability that~$B$ ``wins''
its experiment.  When building your adversary~$B$, try to make it as
simple as possible, and as parsimonious as possible with respect to
its resources.  

Finally, write a nice theorem statement to encapsulate
your result.
